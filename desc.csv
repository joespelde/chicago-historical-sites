The 300 West Adams Street Office Building exemplifies several themes in the development of Chicago's Central Area.  As a 1920s-era office building in the West Loop the building reflects the outward expansion of Chicago's office business district from its historic core into former warehouse districts along the Chicago River.  The twelve-story terra cotta-clad building is an excellent example of the Gothic Revival architectural style and a fine example of the important use in Chicago of architectural terra cotta for large-scale commercial buildings.  Through its handsome design and excellent craftsmanship the 300 West Adams Office Building epitomizes the high-rise office building boom of the 1920s and stands today as a significant example of this historic building type.;
One of the city's most outstanding <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=196"">Art Deco-style</a> skyscrapers it is one of four buildings surrounding the Michigan Avenue Bridge that define one of the city's--and nation's--finest urban spaces. The building's base is sheathed in polished granite in shades of black and purple.  Its upper stories which are set back in dramatic fashion to correspond to the city's 1923 zoning ordinance are clad in buff-colored limestone and dark terra cotta.  The building's prominence is further heightened by its unique site.  Due to the jog of Michigan Avenue at the bridge the building is visible the length of North Michigan Avenue appearing to be located in the center of the street.<br/>

		 This 40-story building was the tallest outside of New York City at the time of its construction.  Designed as the ""Jeweler's Building"" it originally housed a parking garage on the second through 22nd floors. The building's terra cotta-clad classical design marks it as one of the most prominent high-rise statements of the so-called City Beautiful Movement.  It is also the most notable work of the partnership of Joachim Giaver and Frederick Dinkelberg who had spent most of their architectural careers with the firm of D.H. Burnham &amp; Company.<br/>

		 Considered the city's best example of a turn-of-the-century luxury hotel the Blackstone also represents--both its exterior and interior--an excellent and rare example of the Modern French style of Beaux-Arts (<a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=204"">Classical Revival</a>) architecture. Built by prominent hoteliers Tracy and John Drake the Blackstone became known as the ""Hotel of Presidents"" serving as host to a dozen U.S. Presidents including Woodrow Wilson Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy.  The Blackstone was the location of the famous ""smoke-filled rooms"" where Warren G. Harding was chosen as the compromise Republican nominee for President in June 1920. (The term which has since become a political cliche was coined by a reporter covering the convention.) The hotel was named for Timothy B. Blackstone a prominent railroad executive and the founding president of the Union Stock Yards whose mansion had stood on the site.<br/>

		 Built in 1904 the Blackstone Library is a stately Classical Revival-style building designed by Chicago architect Solon S. Beman the noted designer of the industrial town of Pullman. It was presented as a gift to the city by Isabel Norton Blackstone in honor of her late husband Timothy Beach Blackstone a Chicago railroad executive and philanthropist. As the first purpose-built library branch in the city the Blackstone represents the Chicago Public Library's early efforts to serve the needs of rapidly growing neighborhoods. The dome of the rotunda is decorated with four semicircular lunette paintings created by Chicago artist Oliver Dennett Grover. The paintings are allegorical murals which convey the themes of Literature Science Labor and Art. Blackstone Library's carved granite entrance portico richly decorated rotunda and glass-floored mezzanine are some of the major historic spaces still intact within the building.

		 The Chicago &amp; Alton Railway Bridge was constructed for the joint use of three railroads: the Chicago &amp; Alton the Illinois Central and the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe railways. Engineer John W. Page of the firm Page &amp; Shnable developed and patented the design of the bridge which is known as a Page trunnion bascule. The Chicago &amp; Alton Railway Bridge is significant for being the first of its kind erected for railroad use and it may be the only one left in existence.  The superstructure is made from steel and operated by using two 124-horsepower motors mounted on a frame between two counterweights.  These counterweights pivot and roll downward tilting the bridge and giving it the appearance of the span rising effortlessly.  The bridge's counterweights are contained within steel plates that visually blend with the structure giving it a graceful appearance.  The bridge is visible from the Stevenson Expressway and Metra and Orange Line trains. Today it is still in use but its mechanism has been disabled since it no longer is raised for navigational purposes.

		 The Chicago &amp; Illinois Western Railway Bridge is a rare-surviving example of a patented bridge design by Theodor Rall.  Although this bridge type was invented by Rall the patent was held by the contractor Strobel Steel Construction Company of Chicago.  The Rall type was one of the designs most frequently used by the railroads in the early twentieth century and is significant for combining the bascule bridge technologies of both rolling and trunnion motion.  The bridge is a single track single-leaf bascule span which runs on an east-west axis over a slip in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal.  This low-profile bridge is supported by three unevenly-spaced piers made from reinforced concrete.  Visible struts are located on the sides of the bridge along with a trunnion which when engaged by an electric motor pulls the leaf up and rolls it back wards along the horizontal track girders.  Today the bridge's mechanism has been disabled and it remains in fixed position.

		 Located just north of the Loop the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Bridge is an early example of an overhead counterweight bascule bridge based on the patents of Joseph Baermann Strauss.  Strauss was a prominent engineer who later achieved fame as the designer of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.  The Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Bridge was reported to be the world's longest and heaviest bridge of its type at the time of its completion.  The single-leaf bridge is made from heavily-bolted steel girders and plates whose superstructure consists of a fixed tower and an overhead counterweight comprised of concrete reinforced with a steel skeleton.  The leaf's axis of rotation the main trunnion is located about halfway up the tower and power is provided by a pinion which engages a rack on the operating strut to raise and lower the leaf.  Today the bridge is no longer in service due to the rerouting of passenger traffic and dwindling freight traffic.  It is locked in a raised position creating a massive steel silhouette familiar to residents of the Near North side and commuters on Brown Line and Metra trains.

		 The Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad Bridge is an outstanding example of a ""tower-driven"" vertical-lift bridge.  Located on the Calumet River the bridge is based on the early 20th century patents developed by the Kansas City-based firm of Waddell and Harrington.  The bridge was fabricated and built by the American Bridge Co. of Gary Indiana and the Corbett Construction Company of Chicago.  The spans are suspended between a pair of 210-foot towers and have a vertical lift of 125 feet.  Its towers rest on concrete piers extending 80 to 90 feet to bedrock and the approach spans' piers and abutments are supported by metal shell cast-in-place concrete piles.  The bridge's immense span is vertically raised and lowered by a system of 64 cables and four giant pulleys.  The cables are connected to massive steel-encased concrete counterweights which are suspended within the towers' framework.  The bridge is powered by gasoline motors housed at the base of the north tower.  The Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad Bridge provides a dominating visual presence to the surrounding area.  Today the bridge is no longer in use and is currently in a raised position.

		 When it opened in 1930 this Art Deco-style bank building projected a stylish image on what was one of the busiest commercial districts in Chicago.  The style was based on French design exhibited at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Decoratifs in Paris and further developed by American architects in the 1920s and 30s as a ""modernistic"" style.  Characteristics of the Art Deco style include the building¿s sleek limestone façade geometric ornament and stepped-back parapet.  The grand banking hall features a 28-foot-tall ceiling rich marble finishes and decorative bronze metalwork.  It was designed by Abraham Epstein an accomplished Chicago architect and engineer who also designed the Stock Yards National Bank (a designated Chicago Landmark) five years earlier.

The building is situated at W. 63rd and Halsted Streets the commercial heart of the Englewood neighborhood which during the 1920s boasted the second busiest retail area in Chicago.

		 The Chicago Harbor Lighthouse is the only surviving lighthouse in Chicago and one of only two remaining examples in Illinois.  Built in 1893 the Lighthouse symbolically marks the Chicago Harbor-a historically pivotal point where the nation's maritime transportation network connected the East Coast the Great Lakes and ultimately the Gulf Coast.  During the 1917 renovation of the breakwater the lighthouse was moved to its present location and its attached fog-signal room and boathouse were constructed.  The Lighthouse played such a significant role in the development of Chicago that it is commemorated in a relief sculpture entitled ""The Spirit of the Waters"" located near the LaSalle Street entrance of City Hall. Today its crisp white conical tower rising between two red-roofed buildings is a familiar sight along Chicago's shoreline just east of Navy Pier where the Lighthouse continues to mark the harbor entrance.<br/>

		 The Chicago Orphan Asylum Building exemplifies several layers of Chicago's cultural history.  It was built in 1898-99 by the Chicago Orphan Asylum an organization founded in 1849 to assist orphaned and abandoned children.  The building was finely designed in the Colonial Revival architectural style by architects Shepley Rutan and Coolidge who also designed the original Chicago Public Library and the Allerton Wing of The Art Institute of Chicago. In 1940 the building was sold to the Good Shepherd Community Center and became a significant institutional anchor for the Bronzeville community strongly associated with the literary and artistic movement of the 1930s and 1940s known as the ""Chicago Black Renaissance."" The center's director sociologist Horace Cayton Jr. was the co-author of Black Metropolis a seminal sociological study of Chicago's African-American community that was published in 1945. In 1957 the Chicago Baptist Institute purchased the building and it has since become a noted center of religious education on Chicago's South Side.

		 The Chicago Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Bridge No. Z-2 is a rare asymmetrical ""bobtail"" swing span bridge from the late 19th century.  Its significance lies not only in its design but in the role it played in the historic development of Goose Island carrying the only rail line to the island.  In addition the bridge once carried limited vehicular traffic making it perhaps the only surviving bridge in Chicago that served combined modes of transportation.  The bridge's superstructure is made from 210 tons of steel with a concrete counterweight weighing 140 tons all of which rest on a circular nest of 40 wheels that support the entire weight of the bridge.  When in operation an electric motor engaged the gear mechanism forcing the span to rotate and swing towards the shoreline.  The bridge owes the necessity of its existence to a canal built by William Ogden Chicago's first mayor who was the primary backer for its construction in the mid-1850s.  The canal allowed the island to function as an industrial core for Chicago with tanneries grain elevators a coal yard and steel mill.  Today the bridge's operating mechanism has been disabled and since larger craft no longer use the waterway the bridge remains locked in position.  In 2009 the bridge was restored by the Chicago Department of Transportation and pedestrian and bike paths were installed on the span to connect North Avenue to Goose Island.

		 The Dr. Philip Weintraub House is a significant Chicago example of the first wave of modern houses built in the decade before World War II.  Inside and out the Weintraub House combines the International and Art Moderne Styles with its asymmetrical forms composition and non-historic detailing.  The building is the work of Andrew N. Rebori one of the most idiosyncratic Chicago architects of the early twentieth century and it embodies his innovations in early modern design and spatial planning.  Rebori also designed the Fisher Studio Homes at 1209 N. State Pkwy. in 1936 and the Madonna della Strada Chapel at Loyola University Chicago in 1939 both designated Chicago Landmarks.

<p>Built in 1899 as Isaiah Temple one of Chicago's early Reform Judaism synagogues this Classical Revivial-style building is the last building designed by famed architect and engineer Dankmar Adler.  It is long-admired for its distinctive form and fine acoustics and exhibits many characteristics associated with the work of Adler - who is best known for such works as the Auditorium Building and the Garrick Theater both designed in partnership with Louis Sullivan.  The building's prominent entrance portico with Ionic columns entablature and balustrade leads to a dramatic 1200-seat auditorium with a vaulted and coffered ceiling and a ""horseshoe"" gallery.</p>
<br/>
<p>The building was purchased in 1921 by the congregation of the Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church.  A decade later the first modern gospel choir was formed at Ebenezer. Under the direction of musical pioneers Professor Theodore R.

Recalling the temples of Classical antiquity the design features two-story tall arched window openings and giant-order Corinthian columns.  The building is clad in light-gray terra cotta which is molded with ornamental motifs such as urns garlands cartouches and griffins.  The original bronze entrance doors are surrounded within a richly-ornamented terracotta portico topped with a scrolled pediment framing a clock face.  The building's architect Karl M.

		 The Garfield Boulevard ""L"" Station part of Chicago's original ""Alley L"" is one of the oldest intact elevated rail stations in the United States.  The Alley L-so-called because it ran above the alley between State Street and Wabash Avenue-was originally built to service the City's South Side residents but the line was quickly extended south to Jackson Park in order to provide direct access to the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The Garfield Boulevard Station was built as part of that expansion in 1892.  The station and its steel overpass spanning Garfield Boulevard are a unique remaining part of the Alley L now part of the Chicago Transit Authority's Green Line.  While most of the elevated line ran above the alley and therefore required little architectural detail the ornamental steel overpass here was designed to complement the landscaped boulevard below and serve as a gateway to the surrounding Washington Park community.

The interior includes a two-story rotunda with a colorful patterned terrazzo floor and marble-clad walls decorated with sculptural panels.  The Garfield Park Fieldhouse was built in 1928 as the headquarters for the West Park Commission and converted into a fieldhouse in 1934 after the creation of the Chicago Park District.

		 Named for prominent African American surgeon and civic leader Dr. George Cleveland Hall this venerable Bronzeville institution opened on January 18 1932 under the direction of Vivian G. Harsh the first African American to head a branch of the Chicago Public Library.  Harsh compiled an immense African American research collection and initiated pioneering programs promoting the work of noted Chicago writers including from 1933 to 1953 the ""Book Review and Lecture Forum"" an influential discussion group on African American literature current events and social issues.

With its block-like composition random-ashlar stone facades abstracted Classical-style detailing and combination of hip and pyramidal roofs the Hall Branch is unlike any other library in Chicago.

		 The grandly-scaled Germania Club Building is one of Chicago's best-remaining examples of a once-popular building type: the neighborhood club.  The design combines stylistic features of the Romanesque Revival style with its round-arched window openings and thick-masonry walls as well as the Classical Revival style exemplified by the pedimented windows projecting cornice and columned entrance portico.  On the interior the building features grand historic spaces including a double-height ballroom and a large dining room.

The club traces its roots back to a men's chorus made up of German-American Civil War veterans who sang at President Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Chicago in 1865.  From the Germania Club Building's completion in 1889 through much of the twentieth century the building served as a focal point for Chicago's German-American community the city's most populous ethnic group at the turn of the last century.

A dominant figure of 20th-century American poetry and a leading force in the Chicago Black Renaissance literary movement from the 1930s thru the 1950s Brooks is regarded by literary critics as one of the United States' most significant poets.  Her first collection of poems A Street in Bronzeville appeared in 1945 and was followed by other major works including Annie Allen in 1949.  In 1950 Brooks became the first African American in history to win a Pulitzer Prize; in 1985 she was named Poet Laureate of the State of Illinois.  For over seven decades the poetry of Gwendolyn Brooks provided personal and communal insight into the desire and disillusionment humor and injustice of African American life experiences on Chicago's South Side.

		 The Harriet F. Rees House was built in 1888 on Upper Prairie Avenue one of Chicago's most prestigious residential neighborhoods in the late 19th century. Today it is only one of seven historic homes still standing on Prairie Avenue between 18th Street and Cermak Road. Designed by nationally-renowned architects Cobb &amp; Frost it is an excellent and remarkably intact example of the Romanesque Revival style as expressed in the urban townhouse type. The ornate limestone exterior and the interior detailed in rich woods and filled with fireplaces and other built-in features is virtually unchanged from its original historic appearance.

		 These buildings provide the best remaining example of what the east side of the Loop looked like prior to the skyscraper boom of the 1890s.  All three buildings were designed by prominent post-Fire architects including the city's first registered architect John Mills Van Osdel.  The bottom two floors of the Haskell Building were remodeled in 1896 by master architect Louis Sullivan.

		 One of the few streets along the city's north shore that was developed for--and has largely retained--large residences on large lots. After a shoreline drive began to be constructed in the 1890s the McConnell brothers created large lots to attract buyers who wanted proximity to downtown but with larger yards than typically found in the city.  Both brothers built their own homes on the street and set the tone for subsequent development which includes works by such architects as Burnham &amp; Root and Pond &amp; Pond. The openness of the district makes it an oasis between the density of the Broadway retail district and the high rises along Lake Shore Drive.<br/> </span>]"

		 Located in the Old Town Triangle Chicago Landmark District this stone-fronted rowhouse is individually distinguished as the home of pioneering gay civil-rights activist Henry Gerber (1892-1972) between 1924 and 1925.  During his residency here Gerber formed the Society for Human Rights the first American gay civil-rights organization whose newsletter Friendship and Freedom was the first documented gay civil-rights publication in the United States.<br/><p>While serving with the U.S. Army of Occupation in Germany from 1920 to 1923 Gerber became active in the emerging German gay civil-rights movement.  He may have been involved in the publication of German gay civil-rights periodicals at that time laying the foundation for his later work in Chicago.  Upon his relocation to Chicago Gerber established the Society for Human Rights with a group of early gay civil-rights advocates who were willing to accept the personal risk of publicly identifying themselves as homosexuals at a time when gay men and lesbians routinely faced discrimination harassment and imprisonment.<br/>

		 The Illinois Central Railroad Swing Bridge is one of only a few surviving swing-span railroad bridges in Chicago.  The bridge which dates from the late 19th century was part of the system of fifteen bridges constructed by the Sanitary District of Chicago to cross the Sanitary and Ship Canal.  Construction on the Canal began in 1892; at its completion in 1900 the 28-mile waterway effectively reversed the natural flow of the Chicago River from east to west.  The bridge¿s span is set atop a central pier which when fully open creates a navigable channel on either side of the pier.  The bridge rests on ashlar limestone abutments on the river embankments while its center pier is made of cast concrete and limestone.  It was originally built for the short-line Illinois Northern Railroad which was part of the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe.  The bridge's operating machinery has been removed and its span is locked in fixed position.

		 One of the oldest extant structures in the City of Chicago the Illinois-Indiana State Boundary Marker was constructed to commemorate the establishment of the common boundary between the two states in 1833. Boundary surveying was necessary for the sale of land within new states and territories and commemorative markers were often erected following the establishment of such boundary lines. Built of large sandstone blocks the marker is in the shape of an obelisk a traditional form for commemorative markers.  In 1988 the marker was relocated approximately 191 feet north of its original site but remains on the state line.<br/>

		 This is one of the defining commercial high-rises of the post-World War II era of modern architecture. The use of stainless steel cladding is an eloquent testimony to the corporation that commissioned the building as its headquarters.  The placement of all structural columns on the building's perimeter and the consolidation of elevators and other service functions in a separate tower allowed for a highly flexible interior floor layout.  It was the first skyscraper to be built in the Loop following the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Its principal designers were Bruce Graham and Walter Netsch of the SOM architecture firm.<br/>

It was built in 1875 and reflects the design influence of noted Chicago architect John Edelmann whose King School (now demolished) was the prototype for a series of early school buildings.  The Ward Public School is a handsome Italianate-style building with decorative lintels and cornice and was named for James Ward an important early figure in the development of Chicago's public school system. Later additions were designed in compatible architectural styles by Chicago Board of Education architects Normand S. Patton and John C. Christensen.

They began in a then-dilapidated 33-year-old mansion that had been built by real estate developer Charles J. Hull.  By 1907 however the settlement had grown into a 13-building complex that enveloped the original building. In 1963 the settlement moved from this site when it was acquired for the new Chicago Circle Campus of the University of Illinois. As a memorial to Jane Addams the university retained the original Hull-House Residents Dining Hall (dating to 1905) and rebuilt missing portions of the original Hull House.<br/>

		 Located in the heart of Chicago's Loop this district is distinctive and significant as an important and unique part of Chicago's famous downtown shopping district centered on State Street and Wabash Avenue. Comprised of a distinguished group of buildings important in the development of Chicago commercial architecture the district includes important building types such as post-Chicago Fire loft manufacturing buildings Chicago School loft manufacturing mercantile and office buildings early twentieth-century skyscrapers and Art Deco-style mercantile buildings.  These buildings were designed in a variety of architectural styles including Italianate Chicago School and Art Deco by significant Chicago architects including John Mills Van Osdel Hill &amp; Woltersdorf Adler &amp; Sullivan D. H. Burnham &amp; Co. Holabird &amp; Roche Alfred Alschuler Christian Eckstorm and Graham Anderson Probst &amp; White.

The district is also significant for its association with the economic and social history of Chicago as the historic center since the first decade of the twentieth century of jewelry manufacturing and trade silver manufacturing and watch manufacturing and repair in Chicago.  These typically small-scale entrepreneurial businesses traditionally have occupied both ground-floor storefronts and upper-floor offices in the district's buildings. </span>]"

<p>Located in Chicago's South-Side Kenwood neighborhood the Kenwood United Church of Christ is an outstanding Richardsonian Romanesque-style church building a popular late 19th-century architectural style based on the work of nationally-renowned architect Henry Hobson Richardson. The building's rough-textured granite and sandstone walls; corner bell tower; round-arched entrances windows and tower openings; and foliate-detailed columns and sculptural panels comprise a textbook example of this medieval-influenced style.  A 1924 gymnasium wing by architects Chatten and Hammond is designed in a modest twentieth-century variation on the Romanesque Revival and complements the older church building.</p>
<br/>
<p>The building was originally built for the Kenwood Evangelical Church conceived as a nondenominational ""community church"" that drew congregants from throughout the Kenwood community.  Members included John G. Shedd president of Marshall Field &amp; Co. and the benefactor of the Shedd Aquarium and Edgar Lee Masters noteworthy poet and author of Spoon River Anthology.</p>
<br/>
<p>The building is a rare-surviving work of architect William W. Boyington working in association with Harry B. Wheelock.  Boyington was one of the earliest architects working in Chicago arriving in the city in 1853.  During his more than forty-year practice Boyington designed many of the burgeoning city's most prominent buildings almost all of which were either destroyed in the Chicago Fire of 1871 or subsequently lost to redevelopment.  Four that remain are Chicago Landmarks: the iconic Old Chicago Water Tower and the Pumping Station on North Michigan Ave.; the Rosehill Cemetery Gatehouse on N. Ravenswood Ave. on Chicago's North Side; and the Soldier's Home on E. 35th St. on Chicago's South Side.</p>

		 This building is a fine example of the impressive bank buildings constructed in Chicago's neighborhoods during a period of national prosperity in the 1920s.  Like many banks from that time it uses the Classical Revival style of architecture to convey a sense of security and permanence.  The street-facing facades features finely crafted brick masonry pierced with an arcade of two-story tall arched window openings.  Especially noteworthy is the building's extensive Classical-style ornamentation in terra cotta which includes medallions urns acanthus leaves and lion¿s heads.  The bank was founded by Raymond G.

Built from patents by Kansas City-based engineering firm of Waddell and Harrington these bridges are a prominent visual landmark in the surrounding area.  The pair consists of two adjacent double-track steel-truss spans that together make up the largest multiple installation of Waddell and Harrington's patented design.  The towers that support the spans share a foundation with a remnant of the Pittsburgh Fort Wayne &amp; Chicago Bridges.  Operating on the same principles as an elevator the spans are raised and lowered by a system of cables and pulleys.  The spans which were designed to operate independently or as a single unit were driven by motors located in a control room.  Today the operating machinery has been removed and the spans are locked in a partially raised position.  The massive structures are easily seen from the Chicago Skyway.

At the height of his influence Yerkes controlled eight separate street railway companies and 250 miles of track in the city.<br/><p>The powerhouse was constructed to house engines that moved two miles of cable through channels laid in streets on the Near North Side and in the Loop business district.  Those cables in turn pulled the thousands of cable cars that at the peak of their operation brought approximately 100000 workers into downtown Chicago each day.  The LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse helped make possible the rapid development of the city's outlying North Side neighborhoods during one of the greatest boom periods in the history of Chicago.<br/>

This group of houses was built by printer and mapmaker Andrew McNally as speculative housing in 1875.  McNally was co-founder of Rand McNally &amp; Co. which became one of the United States' leading mapmaking companies after its founding in 1868.  The row houses were designed in the Italianate architectural style which was a significant style in the history of Chicago.  They are distinguished by their large blocks of pale yellow Joliet limestone once an extremely popular building stone in Chicago.

		 Occupying an entire city block the monumental he Robert Lindblom Technical High School Building was built during a time of expansion of Chicago's public school system and conveys a period of civic pride and investment in public education in the early twentieth century in Chicago.  The building is also a powerful manifestation of the City Beautiful a movement that emerged from the Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 that promoted urban planning and Classical Revival-style architecture to improve the quality of life in rapidly growing cities.  The Classical Revival-style building with its grandly-scaled portico carried by Ionic columns houses a wide variety of educational spaces including classrooms workshops a grand auditorium and a swimming pool reflecting Progressive-Era educational reforms which emphasized social physical and vocational programs in public education.

		 This sprawling district on Chicago's Northwest Side is centered on Logan and Palmer Squares and the landscaped boulevards that extend outward from them. The district exemplifies the high-quality middle- and upper-class residential institutional religious and commercial architecture constructed in Chicago's neighborhoods during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and remains one of the finest sections of the City's park boulevard system.  The district's buildings largely built between circa 1880 and 1930 are finely designed and crafted in a variety of architectural styles popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In addition one of the City's most distinctive public monuments is the Illinois Centennial Monument in Logan Square and is a visual focus within the District.  The combination of the district's landscaped boulevards and squares combined with the quality of the buildings facing them create a distinctive sense of place. </span>]"

		 For its associations with the Chicago Black Renaissance literary movement and iconic 20th-century African American playwright Lorraine Hansberry the Lorraine Hansberry House possesses exceptional historic and cultural significance.  Although subject to a racially-discriminatory housing covenant this building was purchased in 1937 by African-American real estate developer Carl Hansberry.  Despite threats Hansberry moved his family into the building and waged a three-year-long battle culminating in a U.S. Supreme Court decision that was an important victory in the effort to outlaw racially-restrictive housing covenants.  Hansberry's daughter pioneering playwright Lorraine Hansberry drew inspiration from this traumatic experience when writing A Raisin in the Sun.  This groundbreaking play was the first drama by an African-American woman to be produced on Broadway.

The building later became the Metropolitan Community Church the membership rolls of which contained such notable African-Americans as Ida B. Wells-Barnett Robert S. Abbott and Gwendolyn Brooks.  The church also served as the organizational home for a number of African-American labor unions and social clubs.  Most notably the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters founded by A. Philip Randolph met regularly at the church.

		 This design represents a deliberate break from traditional church architecture.  Originally built as the Third Church of Christ Scientist the building's combination of classical and modern elements demonstrates the architect's search for an appropriate design for the then-new Christian Science religious movement. Hugh M.G. Garden's distinctive ornament often referred to as ""Gardenesque"" can be found throughout.  The building was sold to the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church in 1947.<br/>

		 The Milwaukee Avenue District located in the West Town community area is one of the most intact commercial streets from the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries in Chicago. The district's broad range of architectural styles is a reflection of its history spanning five decades of development; styles include the Italianate Queen Anne Classical Revival Arts and Crafts and Art Deco. Milwaukee Avenue began as an early trade route and matured into an important commercial street for Chicago's economic development. Waves of immigration and shifting ethnic populations in the Milwaukee Avenue District convey important themes of the city's social history. The blending of the distinct variety of cultural histories displayed in the architecture of the buildings creates a ""city within the city"" along the Milwaukee Avenue District. </span>]"

		 The two halves of this building provide a unique perspective for examining the history and development of modern architecture. The north part of the structure--famed for its lack of traditional ornamentation--is carried load-bearing masonry walls with six-foot thick walls at the base.  It was the last skyscraper to employ this method of construction.  The south addition on the other hand is an early example of steel-frame construction its underlying structure revealed through narrow piers and wide windows. Together they mark the end of one building tradition and the beginning of another.<br/>

		 Built as a 1.25-million square foot warehouse and office building by one of the nation's first large mail-order catalog businesses which was founded in 1872 by A. Montgomery Ward and George Thorne. The Catalog House is a visual ""landmark"" along the North Branch of the Chicago River closely hugging the riverbank with its dramatic curving 600-foot-long trapezoidal form. This is one of the best examples of a Chicago School-style industrial building and a pioneering example of large-scale reinforced-concrete construction. Noted architectural historian Carl Condit said: ""This building stands by itself as one of the most powerful works of utilitarian architecture that our building art has produced."" The building's geometric terra-cotta ornament is a rich subtle variation on the modern decoration common to several Chicago School architects including Louis H. Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. The building is listed as a National Historic Landmark due to its significance in the history of American retailing and association with A. Montgomery Ward. A later administration building (1929) and north additions (1917 and 1940) are not part of the Chicago Landmark designation.<br/>

		 This group of commercial buildings on Chicago's Near South Side is considered to be the largest intact early ""automobile row"" in the United States.  Auto rows developed in numerous cities shortly after 1900 as car companies sought to create districts where the sale and repair of cars could become an easy urban shopping experience.  At its peak as many as 116 different makes of automobiles were being sold on Motor Row.  Some are familiar today including Ford Buick Fiat and Cadillac while others are better known to historians and old-car buffs including Hudson Locomobile Marmon and Pierce-Arrow.<br/><p>The range of buildings in Motor Row illustrates the evolution of the automobile showroom and related product and service buildings from simple two-story structures used for display and offices to multi-story buildings housing a variety of departments for the repair storage painting and finishing of automobiles.  Many of these buildings were designed by significant architects including Holabird &amp; Roche Alfred Alschuler Christian Eckstorm Philip Maher and Albert Kahn.<br/> </p></span>]"

		 Navy Pier was inspired by the 1909 Plan for Chicago which called for two large piers projecting into Lake Michigan. Built at a time when Chicago was a major inland port ""Municipal Pier No. 2"" (the other pier was never built) was originally designed to accommodate shipping facilities.  The structure's name was changed in 1927 to honor those who served in the U.S. Navy during World War I.  Shipping declined in the 1930s and during World War II the pier was used for military training. From 1946 to 1965 the pier served as the Chicago campus for the University of Illinois. In 1992 the original sheds were torn down to make way for new recreational/convention uses although the masonry structures located at either end of the pier were retained.<br/>

		 John Eberson became nationally famous as a designer of atmospheric motion picture palaces in which the audience sits within an imaginary courtyard surrounded by exotic buildings under a star-filled sky. The New Regal which originally was known as the Avalon is a prime example of this type of movie theater. Its <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=197"">Middle Eastern</a> Moorish design was reportedly inspired by a Persian incense burner that the architect found in an antique market.  The theater was renamed in 1985 following a major renovation in honor of the Regal Theater a long-time center for the performing arts in the city's African-American community.  The original Regal Theater which was located at 4719 S. King Dr. was demolished in 1973.<br/>

		 Constructed in 1889 the Richard Nickel Studio at 1810 W. Cortland St. was owned for a three-year-period from 1969 to 1972 by architectural photographer Richard Nickel a prominent and significant figure in the early historic preservation movement in Chicago. Nickel's passionate but ultimately unsuccessful crusade to save Adler &amp; Sullivan's Garrick Theater in 1960 is generally regarded as one of the first and most prominent grass-roots preservation efforts in Chicago. Nickel purchased 1810 W. Cortland in February 1969 and began work to convert it to serve as his home and studio. It is the only building Nickel ever owned and he used it as a base for his architectural salvage work storing and photographing architectural fragments there. His untimely and tragic death while salvaging architectural fragments from the Chicago Stock Exchange in April 1972 however occurred before the studio could be completed. The Richard Nickel Studio retains the majority of the original physical characteristics and design features including its cast-iron street-level storefront with its large display windows brick and limestone wall materials and ornamental pressed-metal cornice.

Both structures were designed in a castellated-<a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=214"">Gothic Revival</a> style.

		 The Old Republic Building is a 23-story office skyscraper designed in the Classical Revival style with finely detailed white terra-cotta crafted by the Northwestern Terra-Cotta Company.  It was commissioned by businessman Herbert Bell as the headquarters for the Bell and Zoller Coal Company and originally named the Bell Building.  In 1956 it was sold to the Old Republic Life Insurance Company and has since been known as the Old Republic Building.  Located on the northeast corner of North Michigan Avenue and East South Water Street the building was one of the first tall buildings to be constructed on the newly widened North Michigan Avenue south of the Chicago River in the early 1920s.  The building exemplifies the commercial development that occurred in the 1920s as a result of major improvements brought about by Burnham and Bennett's 1909 Plan of Chicago including the construction of the North Michigan Avenue bridge and the northward extension of Michigan Avenue as a wide Parisian-style Boulevard.

		 The Pennsylvania Railroad ""Eight-Track"" Bridge also known as the Scherzer Eight-Track Bridge is an example of a patented bascule bridge design by engineer William Scherzer. It is made of steel and comprised of four side-by-side Scherzer rolling-lift single-leaf double-track spans set in alternating positions which can not only operate as four independent bridges but can also operate simultaneously as a single unit.  The configuration of the bridge makes it one of the most unusual looking bridges in the city of Chicago.  The structure rests on the limestone piers of prior bridges and is reinforced with metal shell cast-in-place concrete piles.  Each bridge was operated by two 50-horsepower motors which worked in conjunction with reinforced concrete counterweights and rocker arcs.  Today the bridge is fixed in place and still in use.  The structure can be seen from both Western Avenue and the Stevenson Expressway.

		 The Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge was designed by innovative and influential engineers John Alexander Low Waddell and John Lyle Harrington.  Upon its completion in 1914 the bridge had the heaviest main span of any vertical-lift bridge in the United States.  The steel truss span is situated between two towers which rest on concrete piers on the river banks.  A distinctive feature of the structure is the bridge tender's house at the middle of the span.  A system of 64 cables and 32 pulleys engaged to vertically raise the span to provide a clearance of 111 feet above the river.  Today the bridge is in use by both freight and passenger rail traffic and is a familiar visual landmark to visitors of Ping Tom Park and commuters on the CTA Orange Line and Metra and AMTRAK trains.

		 This church houses Chicago's oldest African-American congregation which traces its origins back to 1844 when seven individuals formed a nondenominational prayer group that met in the house of one of its members.  In 1847 the group organized as a congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.  Named for Bishop William P. Quinn the church played an important role in the city's abolitionist movement.  After the Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed the original church the congregation met for many years in temporary locations.  The congregation purchased the present site in 1890 and the current church is a reminder of the late-19th century character of the area.<br/>

		 One of Chicago's finest industrial buildings the R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Calumet Plant was built for one of the City's leading printing houses.  It was built in stages to the design of noted architect Howard Van Doren Shaw best known for his handsome period-style houses in both Chicago and its suburbs.  The Calumet Plant has finely crafted detailing in stone and metal that depict symbols from the history of printing.  The building's prominent corner tower was designed by Philadelphia architect Charles Z. Klauder a nationally recognized expert on the Gothic Revival style after the death of Shaw.  The building is now known as the Lakeside Technology Center.

		 To Chicagoans of the 1890s the glass-covered exterior of this building seemed to almost defy gravity. A century later it is internationally recognized as the direct ancestor of today's glass-and-steel skyscrapers.  Extremely narrow piers mullions and spandrels all covered with cream-colored terra cotta decorated with Gothic-style tracery divide wide expanses of glass and clearly delineate the interior steel framework that supports the building. The light and airy facade is almost entirely windows--both flat and projecting bays--of the type known as a ""Chicago window:"" a wide fixed pane with narrow movable sash windows flanking it. A flat cornice tops the 14-story structure. The severely deteriorated exterior was completely restored by the City of Chicago in 1996.<br/>

		 This two-story residence in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood served as home to celebrated author Richard Wright and his extended family from 1929 to 1932.  While residing in the second-floor apartment Wright effectively began his professional literary career writing his first novel Lawd Today! which was published posthumously in 1963. He earned the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1939 and then published two of his most influential books Native Son (1940) and Black Boy (1945).  Native Son a novel set in the slums of Chicago's South Side was later adapted for stage and screen.  These controversial and powerful texts examined race relations in the 20th-century and are credited with forever changing American culture while catapulting Wright into the national spotlight as one of the most noted writers of Chicago's Black Renaissance literary movement.

		 Of the more than 75 buildings that Frank Lloyd Wright designed in the Chicago area none is more famous or influential than this residence which was designed for Frederick C. Robie a young manufacturer of bicycles.  The affinity of its striking horizontal lines to the flat landscape of the Midwestern prairie came to be associated with an architectural style popularly known as the ""<a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=201"">Prairie School</a>.""  The building's low overhanging roof and the long wall around its base give a sense of privacy to the occupants while the roof's sweeping horizontality makes the house seem longer and lower than it actually is. This design which was a marked contrast to traditional houses of the period signaled a turning point in modern residential architecture.<br/>

		 This former Schlitz Brewery stable and the tied house located one block south are rare surviving buildings from ""Schlitz Row"" a complex located just outside the ""Dry"" industrial town of Pullman that originally included three tied-houses and housing for Schlitz workers.  The stable was used to house horses and carriages which Schlitz used to deliver its products to the tied house taverns it owned and it exemplifies the vertigal integration that defined the tied house system.  The brick building is symmetrical with a wagon entrance at the center of the street-level facade flanked on either side by a pair of arched openings. At the second story the corner piers of the building include blind-arched openings framing recessed brick and stucco panels with distinctive terra-cotta horse-head sculptures.

When it was built Schlitz had become one of the largest breweries in the nation and its Chicago market was managed by Edward Uihlein who built at least 57 other tied-houses in the city.

The building's high-quality architectural design and cheerful German Renaissance style of architecture was intended to attract customers and to project a positive image in the face of rising opposition to alcohol and neighborhood taverns.

		 The former Schlitz Brewery-Tied House at 5120 N. Broadway is a fine example of the architecturally-distinctive taverns built in Chicago by brewing companies around the turn of the twentieth century when Schlitz and other brewers adopted the ""tied house"" system to directly sell their products to tavern patrons in Chicago.  When it was built Schlitz was one of the largest breweries in the nation and its Chicago market was managed by Edward Uihlein who built at least 57 other tied-houses in the city.  The building incorporates German Renaissance Revival and Queen Anne stylistic features such as the prominent turret and the lunettes at the top of the turret. Also characteristic of tied-houses the facade includes the belted globe insignia of Schlitz brewery.  Soon after its construction the building became known as the Winona Gardens and it was a destination for actors including Gloria Swanson and Charlie Chaplin working at the nearby Essanay Studios which is also a designated Chicago Landmark.

Schurz High School also represents a significant amalgamation of two important architectural styles.  The strong vertical piers are characteristic of the <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=202"">Chicago School</a> while the overhanging roof detailed brickwork and strong geometric forms are elements identified with <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=201"">Prairie School</a> architecture. A recent (1995) award-winning exterior rehabilitation and cleaning has restored the building's clay tile roof and revealed its original two-color brick scheme. The school is named in honor of the German-born American journalist and political leader Carl Schurz.  (The <a href=""landmarkdetails.htm?lanId=1398"">studio of Perkins</a>' architecture firm at 814 N. Michigan Ave. is also a designated Chicago Landmark.)<br/>

		 A looming presence on Chicago's West Side the Sears Roebuck and Company Administration Building served as the office headquarters for the largest mail order and merchandise company in the United States for more than sixty years. From its founding in 1894 Sears grew rapidly to become one of the country's largest purveyors of goods to small town and rural America as well as one of Chicago's most important companies. The building's original two-story section was built in 1905 while the top three floors were added in 1914.  This stately <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=204"">Classical Revival</a> and <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=202"">Chicago School</a>-inspired building was designed by George C.

		 Fieldhouses like the Shedd Park Fieldhouse were built to serve as the centers of recreational activities in the City's smaller parks in working-class neighborhoods.  The original 1917 portion of the fieldhouse was designed in the Prairie style by William Eugene Drummond a protegee of Frank Lloyd Wright and one of the City's most skilled designers in the Prairie tradition.  The building's rear gymnasium addition also designed in the Prairie style in 1928 was the work of the architectural firm of Michaelsen and Rognstad who produced a variety of excellent historically-inspired designs in Chicago including large fieldhouses for Humboldt Garfield and Douglas Parks.  The fieldhouse was named for Chicago entrepreneur and philanthropist John G. Shedd who donated the land for the surrounding park which also bears his name.

		 A prominent visual landmark in the Uptown community this distinctive terra-clad structure was erected in 1924-25 as an eight-story bank and office building for the Sheridan Trust and Savings Bank.  The demand for office space in Uptown spurred the construction of four additional stories in 1928 designed by Huszagh &amp; Hill.  With its rounded corner and white terra-cotta cladding this tall bank and office building conveys the commercial vitality of the Uptown neighborhood in the 1920s which was especially renowned for its numerous theaters and dance halls.  Chicago architects Marshall and Fox who are also known for their elegant hotel and mansion designs employed a streamlined Classicism for the building's original design which Huszagh and Hill emulated for the top addition.  The grand banking hall located on the second floor is richly finished with marble and ornamental plaster.

		 The Shoreland Hotel located in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood was one of the city's most prominent apartment hotels in the 1920s and 30s.  Apartment hotels could be tailored to accommodate working middle and upper-class residents and emerged as a new building type in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.  The hotel is a reflection of the rapid growth of the city during the 1920s when skyrocketing land values advancing building technologies and shifting tastes made apartment hotels a popular housing choice.  The thirteen-story building was designed by engineer Meyer Fridstein with Spanish Renaissance Revival style detailing.  The building retains significant interiors including a high-ceilinged entrance lobby remodeled in the Art Deco style in the late 1930s and a second-floor ballroom.  During the fifty years that it served as a luxury apartment hotel the Shoreland hosted such famous individuals as Amelia Earhart Eleanor Roosevelt Al Capone Jimmy Hoffa and Elvis Presley.

		 After years of experiments physicist Enrico Fermi and a team of scientists working at the University of Chicago became convinced that if a sufficient quantity of uranium could be brought together under proper conditions a self-sustaining reaction would occur. At 3:25 p.m. on December 2 1942 in makeshift laboratories constructed in an abandoned handball court under the grandstands of the university's Stagg Field Stadium the final experiment was initiated. A 28-minute nuclear chain reaction was started controlled and stopped. The atomic age had begun.

A contingent of police approaching on Desplaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley.

		 The Site of the Sauganash Hotel/Wigwam is important in the history of Chicago's early development.  Mark Beaubien built the Sauganash Hotel in 1831 at Wolf Point on the east bank of the south branch of the Chicago River at the ""forks"" of the River where the north and south branches meet.  It was at the Sauganash Hotel in 1833 that the newly-formed Town of Chicago voted to elected its first town trustees and where many of the town meetings occurred.  During a brief period in 1837 when the building was not in operation as a hotel it served as Chicago's first theater.  The Sauganash Hotel remained in almost continuous operation until it burned down in 1851.<p>The Wigwam constructed on the same site nine years later was home to the 1860 Republican National Convention.  It was at this historic convention that Abraham Lincoln was nominated as the Republican candidate for president.  His nomination and eventual election as the nation's 16th President triggered a series of dramatic events surrounding the abolition of slavery and the secession of several southern states ultimately culminating in the Civil War. His powerful leadership skills are credited with having led the country successfully through perhaps its darkest time.<br/>

The building is a significant example of the Art Moderne architectural style with its sleek lines and vertical ribbons of glass block.  It is located within the Central Manufacturing District a pioneering planned industrial district in Chicago's Bridgeport and McKinley Park community areas that was influential in industrial-park planning throughout the United States.

		 This is one of Chicago's most visually striking 1920s-era skyscrapers in Chicago.  Designed in the Gothic Revival architectural style the building is an outstanding example of a terra-cotta-clad skyscraper ornamented with a plethora of Gothic ornament including pointed arches tracery finials and flying buttresses.  The building was designed by Karl M. Vitzthum one of Chicago's significant early twentieth-century architects and the designer of the One North LaSalle Building (a designated Chicago Landmark) as well as a number of distinctive neighborhood bank buildings throughout Chicago.

		 Completed in 1925 this grandly-scaled Colonial Revival-style building originally housed two banks that served the industries and employees of the nearby Union Stock Yards and Central Manufacturing District.  With its Palladian windows and central clock tower the design is closely modeled on Independence Hall in Philadelphia.  Interest in Colonial architecture grew in the 1920s due to the Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition of 1926 in Philadelphia and the restoration and reconstruction of Colonial Williamsburg in the 1920s.  The building was designed by Abraham Epstein a Chicago architect and engineer who is perhaps best-known for his designs for the reconstruction of the Union Stock Yards after a fire in 1934.

		 Following a 1921 remodeling this simple automobile garage was transformed into one of the city's earliest and most legendary jazz venues.  Its house orchestra featured such famed musicians as Louis Armstrong Johnny Dodds and Earl ""Fatha"" Hines while its floor shows introduced the latest dances to local audiences.  Many promising young artists including Bix Beiderbecke Jimmy Dorsey Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa got their start at late-night sessions here.  After a 1937 remodeling it was renamed the Grand Terrace Cafe and remained a popular night club until 1950.

Gillespie (as the Liberty Life Insurance Company) the firm moved in 1921 into the second floor of this building which had been constructed by the Roosevelt State Bank.  Liberty Life bought the entire structure in 1924 and in 1929  merged with two out-of-state firms to form the Supreme Life Insurance Company of America.

		 Sheathed in gleaming highly-ornamental white terra cotta the former Swedish American State Bank is a visually-outstanding building on this vibrant commercial section of Clark Street.  The bank was founded to serve the large Swedish population that settled in Edgewater's southwestern edge around Clark Street between Foster and Bryn Mawr Avenues which became known as ""Andersonville.""  The free and unusual interpretation of the Classical Revival style of architecture is characteristic of the architectural firm of Ottenheimer Stern and Reichert.

The buildings and unusual terra-cotta walls were built by Northwestern Terra Cotta Company executives and exemplify changing taste in architectural styles from <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=203"">Queen Anne</a> to Viennese Modern.  Northwestern Terra Cotta was one of three major terra-cotta manufacturing companies located in Chicago in the heyday of architectural terra-cotta manufacture during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

		 With its straightforward use of Chicago common brick and simple wood elements this unassuming but visually-distinctive church building is an early Chicago example of a house of worship built in the modern style of architecture.  The unusual design reflects the progressive character of the Unitarian congregation as well as the financial constraints imposed by the Great Depression at the time it was built.  When it was completed the Third Unitarian Church Building was widely published in national architectural journals and was recognized by contemporary critics as an important work of architecture.  Following this successful design architect Paul Schweikher went on to play an important role in the development of modern architecture in America through his architectural practice and as head of the Yale School of Architecture.  The respectful addition to the north (left side of photo) from 1956 is by William Fyfe who worked with Schweikher during the design of the original building.

		 Intended as a home for artists at the end of the nineteenth century the Tree Studios was constructed by philanthropists Judge and Mrs. Lambert Tree using the finest craftsmanship and details of the period.  The original 1894 building facing State Street was designed in a Queen Anne style and is lined with retail storefronts that provided rental income that subsidized the rents for the artists' studios.  The 1912 and 1913 annexes built on Ohio and Ontario Streets were designed in the English <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=198"">Arts and Crafts</a> style.  The building's large windows picturesque details and distinctive interior courtyard instantly made it a unique cultural oasis and home to many significant artists including sculptors Albin Polasek and John Storrs; illustrator J.

The various competition entries proved extremely influential for the development of skyscraper architecture in the 1920s.  The winning entry with a crowning tower with flying buttresses is derived from the design of the French cathedral of Rouen and gives the building its striking silhouette.  The base of the building is studded with over 120 stones from famed sites and structures in all 50 states and dozens of foreign countries.

		 The Veseman Building is an unusually colorful and detailed terra cotta-clad building designed in the French-influenced version of the Art Deco style.  The building's pastel-hued façade reflects the appeal of color in architecture in the late 1920s and early 1930s as advances in terra-cotta production made possible a vast array of details and colors for building design.  At that time Chicago was the national center of terra-cotta manufacturing and the building reflects the popularity of this building material and the significance of the industry in Chicago.  The Veseman Building's current appearance dates to 1930 the result of the widening of North LaSalle Street in the late 1920s as part of the City of Chicago's implantation of the 1909 Plan of Chicago.  Today the Veseman Building is one of the finest surviving and most intact examples of polychromatic terra-cotta in Chicago.

The building's limestone façade is carved with the bust of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn the German founder of the Turner Movement and the intertwined letters ""FFST"" which stand for the German words ""Frisch Fromm Stark &amp; Treu"" and represents the basic principles of the turner movement: ""Healthy Upright Strong &amp; True.""  In addition to gymnastics members of the Turnverein Vorwaerts helped establish physical education programs in Chicago's public schools and recreation facilities in the city's parks.

		 An important center of community life this Young Men's Christian Association facility also provided housing and job training for new arrivals from the South during the ""Great Migration"" of African-Americans in the first decades of the 20th century.  A notable aspect of the building's diverse history was the founding here in 1915 of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History one of the first groups devoted to African-American studies.  The building was expanded to the south in 1945.  It closed as a YMCA in the late 1970's.

		 At the time of its construction in the aftermath of the Fire of 1871 the Washington Block was one of the tallest buildings in the city. It is a critical link to understanding the evolution of the Chicago skyscraper a rare surviving example of the use of the ""isolated pier foundation"" which was an engineering advancement that helped develop the high-rise office building. The ornate detailing of its virtually intact limestone facades makes the Washington Block a building of individual architectural distinction.  The building originally featured an outside staircase that led to an ornate second-floor corner entrance. The lobby still includes a rare example of a curving hardwood staircase.<br/>

		 Wendell Phillips High School has been a significant educational center for Chicago's African-American community for more than 80 years educating many who rose to prominence in the arts and other professions.  Built in 1904 the school is a handsome <a href=""styledetails.htm?styId=204"">Classical Revival</a> building by prominent Chicago architect William Bryce Mundie.  The school was named for Wendell Phillips (1811-1884) the staunch abolitionist who was one of the leading figures in the American anti-slavery movement.  Early yearbooks portray a racial mix in the student body but by 1920 the school had become Chicago's first predominately African-American high school. During this period the school's winning basketball teams formed the nucleus of a group that later became the Harlem Globetrotters.  Numerous noteworthy individuals have attended Wendell Phillips and been inducted in their ""Hall of Fame"" including well-known alumni such as entertainers Nat ""King"" Cole and Dinah Washington businessmen John H. Johnson and George E. Johnson and Alonzo S. Parham the first African-American to attend West Point.  Maudelle Brown Bousfield the school's principal from 1939 to 1950 was the first African-American principal of a Chicago public school and was an important civic leader.<br/>

<p>Built in 1930 the White Castle #16 building remains the best-surviving example in Chicago of the buildings built by the White Castle System of Eating Houses Inc. a trailblazing national fast-food company in the history of the United States.  White Castle was the first national chain to popularize hamburgers and the building exemplifies the company's pioneering standardization of menu and service; its focus on affordable and tasty food intended primarily for take-out; its emphasis on cleanliness; and its use of extensive newspaper advertising and outreach to middle-class families.</p>
<br/>
<p>The building is a visually-distinctive white glazed-brick building with unusual medieval-inspired massing and details including a corner tower abstracted buttresses and crenellation.  As such it is an early Chicago example of ""programmatic architecture"" visually-distinctive buildings that served as ""bricks-and-mortar"" advertising for their companies often through visual cues that tied into company values or even actual products sold from the buildings. White Castle's use of white ""castellated"" buildings was a visual reinforcement of the name ""White Castle"" which advertised both permanence and cleanliness two virtues that set White Castle apart from its smaller competitors in the company's early years.</p>
